# RFP

## About
RFPs (Requests For Proposals) are detailed descriptions of a technical problem seeking proposed solutions, the best of which will be funded for execution. This could be a protocol level improvement, a novel algorithm, a developer- or user-facing tool, and so on.

A successful RFP grant requires a detailed problem statement with well-defined acceptance criteria and budget, as well as a Proposal describing the implementation plan and clear deliverables.

If you're interested in a smaller grant with simpler application and reporting requirements, take a look at the [microgrants](../MICROGRANTS.md).

If you have a detailed proposal for a project that will broadly benefit the IPFS community that doesn't answer a particular RFP, you may want to try an [open grant proposal](../open-grants).

## How To Propose
### Intended Audience
You're a developer or development team that can complete the work described in an RFP within the budget and up to spec.

### How To
1. Select an open RFP from [this list](.). 
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/protocol/ipfs-grants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=rfp-proposal.md&title=RFP+Proposal%3A+%3CYour+Project+Title%3E) with your proposal, following the template. Be sure to tag the original poster of the RFP to let them know about your proposal.

## How To Create RFP
### Intended Audience
You're an organization looking to solicit technical contributions for a well-defined project. You have the necessary technical or product expertise to specify the work, evaluate proposals, and determine the correctness of the result.

### How to
1. Open a PR based on the [RFP template](rfp-template.md) (don't forget to change the file name). Tag your RFP appropriately to help applicants find projects that fit their skills and interests.
2. Watch for new issues referencing your RFP
3. Evaluate and select the proposal best suited to your requirements
4. Once you've affirmatively selected a proposal, we will close any other issues and mark your RFP as "In Progress"

Remember: writing a high quality RFP is a lot of work. It's your responsibility to offer detailed instructions and acceptance criteria to the applicants, review proposals in a timely manner, and evaluate the finished work. RFPs that remain idle for 3 months will be archived.

## How To Help Fund an RFP
### Intended Audience
You're interested in accelerating the development of a specific feature, or perhaps broadly supporting IPFS work as a foundation or private donor.

### How To
Simply add your additional pledge to the document describing the RFP (under "Support and Funding"), or add it in comments of the PR if it is not yet merged.

It may also be a good idea to add invoicing/payment information for your organization to [FUNDING](../FUNDING.md) to make the disbursement process easier.
