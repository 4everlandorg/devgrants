# Next Step Microgrants

## About

IPFS Next Step Microgrants are available to support taking the _Next Step_ after building an initial prototype with IPFS. They are offered with the understanding that decentralized technologies are a rapidly developing field with many unknowns. Next Step Microgrants seek to match the pace, breadth, and experimental nature of this work.

From time-to-time, we may announce a [focus area](FOCUS.md) (such as offline use, GIS, digital democracy, etc) for priority consideration. However, all submissions will always be reviewed.

### Intended Audience
These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, researchers... and you! 

### Award
Next Step Microgrants are awarded in the amount of **$5,000**, paid in FIL tokens. The entire grant amount be used to support work related to integrating or improving IPFS, such as developer time, hosting services, relevant hardware such as a raspberry pi, etc. 

### Applying and Reporting
Next Step Microgrants are intended to be easy to apply for, evaluate, and administer. Projects must meet these 5 criteria:

1. You've already built something with IPFS (or closely related technologies such as IPLD, libp2p, etc.), independently or as part of a course or hackathon.
1. You can provide a clear and straightforward description of the _Next Step_ you plan to take with grant support.
1. You can complete this work within 3 months. 
1. You agree to open-source this work, via MIT license for code or [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVreNvKsQmQZ83T86cWSjPu2vR3yZHGPm5jnxFuunEB9u) license for content.
1. You agree to complete weekly updates and a grant report upon conclusion, with the results of your microgrant-funded work as well as a description of your experience building on IPFS, including any challenges or shortcomings encountered.

We may also contact you about promoting the resulting work, including coverage on [the IPFS Blog](https://blog.ipfs.io/) or social media.

### Timelines
Grant applications are typically reviewed every 2 weeks.
